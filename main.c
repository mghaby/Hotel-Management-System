// Have an ASCII UI that asks if you want to book a room, check out of a room or go in a room.
// If you want to book a room it will return what rooms are available and you can select a room. 
    // After you select a room it will give you a randomly generated password

// If you want to go inside a room you have to enter what room and the password.
    // If you enter the wrong password you will be told that you have entered the wrong password.
    // If you enter the correct password you will be able to enter the room.

// If you want to check out a room you must enter the room number and the password and the room will be checked out.
    // If you enter the wrong password you will be told that you have entered the wrong password.
    // If you enter the correct password you will be told that you have checked out of the room.

// The "Database" will be a text file or JSON file that will hold the room numbers and the status of the rooms.
